# Support Policy

Find out how our Technical Support can assist you with your needs and inquiries.

### About Our Support Policy

- Technical Support is provided for supported versions of Rocscience software—the currently distributed version, as listed on the Program Downloads page.
- Email support is available only to customers with an active **Maintenance+** subscription. See the Maintenance+ page for more details.
- **Confidentiality**: When you send your models for support, rest assured that Rocscience will not share them without your permission.
- **Turnaround Time**: Rocscience strives to respond within **24 hours**, though this is not guaranteed and depends on the complexity of your model or query, and support volume.

### Technical Support Coverage

### What’s Covered
- Installation assistance
- Questions about program features and functionality, such as:
  - “Can program X be used to model Y?”
  - Modeling-specific queries, e.g., which option to use for a particular boundary condition
  - Understanding the program’s capabilities or how to obtain specific results

### What’s Not Covered
Technical Support is **not** intended for design decisions or project-specific advice. Examples of non-covered services include:
- Use of third-party software
- Theoretical explanations of geotechnical analysis or finite element principles
- Project-specific modeling or modifying your files
- Approving your model or its parameters
- Selecting material properties or constitutive models
- Interpreting the realism of results (e.g., assessing if a factor of safety is reasonable)

For advanced, project-specific help, consider **Rocscience Expert Modeling**, available as a training service (fee-based).

### Appending a Model to Your Query

### With Active Maintenance+
- You're welcome to send models for support; in some cases, Rocscience may return a **modified model**, in line with their policy.
- However, long, iterative modeling support (i.e., building your project step-by-step) is beyond the scope of standard support. Expert Modeling may be recommended instead.

### Without Maintenance+
- Access to support is limited to **online help resources**.
- Bug investigations will be conducted if a file is submitted, but model-specific guidance will not be provided.

### Phone Technical Support
- Intended as a supplement to email support, especially for feature clarification.
- Not meant for real-time model review during the call.

### Technical Support for Academic Bundle
- Graduate students must include supervisor comments and CC the supervisor in their support email.
- Include your technical support information (accessible via *Help → Technical Support* in the program).
- Commercial customers with Maintenance+ have priority, so response times may vary.

### Software Security Policy

- You are responsible for the security of your installation environment.
- Rocscience desktop applications only communicate with their servers in two cases:
  1. **License activation** — via RocActivate utility, transmitting encrypted device fingerprint data.
  2. **Program updates** — at startup, the software checks for newer versions, sending only program name and version.
- No other data is transmitted.
- **Offline activation** is available via fingerprint file if you prefer not to connect online.
- For **network licenses**, ensure port **1947 (TCP & UDP)** is open for client-server communication.
